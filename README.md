# Image Rotation and Resizing using Image Processing

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing fundamental **image processing operations**, specifically **image rotation** and **image resizing**. These operations are widely used in computer vision, digital image editing, medical imaging, and machine learning preprocessing.

The system takes an input image, applies rotation by a specified angle, resizes the image according to given dimensions or scaling factors, and produces a processed output image.

## 🧠 Project Description

### 1. Image Rotation
Image rotation involves rotating an image by a specific angle around its center. This project uses affine transformation techniques to rotate images clockwise or counterclockwise without losing essential visual information.

### 2. Image Resizing
Image resizing changes the dimensions of an image. The project supports:
- Resizing by specifying width and height
- Resizing using a scale factor

Interpolation methods are used to maintain image clarity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)
